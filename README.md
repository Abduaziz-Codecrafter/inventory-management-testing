# Inventory Management and Server System

## Overview

The **Inventory Management and Server System** is a scalable, efficient, and secure full-stack application designed to manage inventory data, visualize trends, and provide interactive user features. It comprises two main components:

1. **Inventory Management Frontend**: A modern web application built with React and Next.js for managing inventory data and providing rich user interactions.
2. **Backend Server**: A robust server built using Node.js and Express, providing APIs for inventory management, authentication, and database operations.

This project demonstrates best practices in full-stack development and leverages industry-standard tools and frameworks.

## Key Features

### Frontend (Inventory Management)
- **Interactive Data Grid**: Sort, filter, and search functionality powered by Material-UI.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate insightful charts and graphs using Recharts.
- **State Management**: Efficiently managed with Redux Toolkit, including session persistence.
- **Responsive Design**: Cross-device compatibility achieved with Tailwind CSS and Material-UI.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication and role management integrated with the backend.

### Backend (Server)
- **Express Framework**: Lightweight and efficient backend architecture.
- **Prisma ORM**: Simplifies database operations with schema-driven migrations and queries.
- **Secure API**: Implements security measures using Helmet and CORS.
- **Middleware Support**: Logging, error handling, and request parsing via Morgan and Body-Parser.
- **Development Utilities**: Tools like Nodemon and Concurrently streamline development and testing.
