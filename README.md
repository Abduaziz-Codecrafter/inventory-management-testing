Inventory Management and Server System
Overview

This project consists of two main components:

    Inventory Management Frontend: A modern web application built with React and Next.js to manage inventory data, visualize trends, and provide interactive features for users.
    Backend Server: A robust server built using Node.js and Express, providing APIs for inventory data handling, authentication, and database interactions.

The system is designed to be scalable, efficient, and secure, utilizing industry-standard tools and frameworks for both frontend and backend development.
Key Features
Inventory Management (Frontend)

    Interactive Data Grid: Powered by Material-UI and supports sorting, filtering, and searching.
    Data Visualization: Built with Recharts to provide insights through charts and graphs.
    State Management: Efficiently handled using Redux Toolkit with persistence for user sessions.
    Responsive Design: Ensures compatibility across devices with Tailwind CSS and Material-UI.
    Authentication: Seamless integration with the backend for user authentication and role management.

Server (Backend)

    Express Framework: Provides a lightweight and fast backend architecture.
    Prisma ORM: Simplifies database management with schema-driven migrations and queries.
    Secure API: Protected using Helmet and CORS for secure data exchange.
    Middleware Support: Includes logging, error handling, and request parsing with tools like Morgan and Body-Parser.
    Development Utilities: Tools like Nodemon and Concurrently enable faster development and testing.

Technology Stack
Frontend

    React & Next.js: For dynamic UI and server-side rendering.
    Material-UI & TailwindCSS: For styling and design.
    Redux Toolkit: For state management.
